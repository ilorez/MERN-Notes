## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. It's known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications.

## JavaScript Foundations

Before diving into Node.js, it's essential to have a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. Topics to cover include variables, functions, control flow, objects, arrays, and asynchronous programming concepts.

## Getting Started with Node.js

Get started with Node.js by:

- Installing Node.js on your machine.
- Setting up a basic Node.js project.
- Running your first Node.js script.

## Core Modules

Node.js provides a set of core modules that you can use to perform common tasks. Some essential modules to explore include `fs` for file operations, `http` for creating web servers, and `events` for working with event-driven programming.

## Asynchronous Programming

Learn how to work with asynchronous code in Node.js. Understand callbacks, Promises, and async/await to handle non-blocking operations effectively.

## Working with Files

Explore the `fs` module in Node.js for reading and writing files. Understand file I/O operations, file streams, and error handling.

## Building a Simple Web Server

Node.js can be used to create web servers. Learn how to build a basic web server using the `http` module, handle HTTP requests, and serve static files.
